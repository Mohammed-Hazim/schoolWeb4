      The food optioms and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organized and more efficient than they have beeen in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietaryrequiremnets they may have. Ordering online by ticketing a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

    <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
      Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students' absentooim. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their class and not ready to establish connectivity with the school concepts of their curriculur's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Number or Name, details like availibility in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span - just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational instituitons as the students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absentooism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
